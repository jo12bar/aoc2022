# Advent of Code 2022

My personal solutions for Advent of Code 2022.

## Building

```shell
cargo build
```

## Running a challenge solver

Make sure that the challenge input is loaded into `input/01a.txt` or `input/22b.txt` and so on.
Then, run:

```shell
cargo run -- 1 a
```

Run `cargo run -- -h` for a more detailed explanation of how the challenge CLI works.
